In Remory,

The swing willows at the lake,

the flying butterfly on the flowers,

many great memories about you in the brain,

such as the warmth of the sun shining,

now,i still treasured in my heart.

...

And Afterward,

The fallen leaves on the side of the road,

the clothes fluttering with flying dust,

autumn rain was falling quietly,

such as words in the ear circled,

although do not want to say farewell,

finally,you left without any words.

...

I find any stories continuously 

in the depths of the memories that overï¼Œ

I lost myself accidently 

in the words that writen in many papers.

...

at the end,

i am confused, afflictive and exhausted.

I think that have lost all of great friends.

i'm not sure whether it is a illusion

that life gave me.

I'm so sorry that i thought,

....

Don't know if we each have a destiny,

or if we're all just floating around accidental

like on a breeze;

don't konw if we miss each other all the time,

or maybe we have forgotten long time ago,

because of the distance interconnection.

after a long time,

...

just can understand that

the greatest enemy within is myself,

and be in the loneliest place on earth.

Promise never retreat and downhill

to be a person

who knows how to be silent and always keep aspiring.

to be a person

who can accept defeat but never give up and never say never.

...

insight on life

know to understand tolerance and to be grateful

we all have moments of desperation

just we face them head on

that's when we find out

how strong and brave we really are

many many times

i tell myself that don't become what i want

just become who i believed in deepth of heart

but the only thing i'm afraid of is

lost you instead of lost myself

...

After long time gone,

i just understand that

the best and most beautiful things in the world is that

to see the people who I cherish and protect,

and to achieve every little wish about her,

and give her many pleasantly surprised beyond expectation.

and smile when see her smile,

and something cannot be seen or even touched,

they must be felt with the heart,

but i don't have a chance to do that again.

you cannot feeling my deeply missing later,

however,i still feeling that in dreams every night,

that's the rest of tidings about you,

and my faith which from you not life.
